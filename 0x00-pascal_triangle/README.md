# Must Know

To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:

1. **Lists and List Comprehensions:**

    - Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
    - Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

2. **Functions:**

    - Know how to define and call functions.
    - Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.

3. **Loops:**

    - Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through sequences.
    - Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.

4. **Conditional Statements:**

    - Apply `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).

5. **Recursion (Optional):**

    - While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.

6. **Arithmetic Operations:**

    - Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of - - Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

7. **Indexing and Slicing:**

    - Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.

8. **Memory Management:**

    - Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.

9. **Error and Exception Handling (Optional):**

    - Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.

10. **Efficiency and Optimization:**

    -Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.

By revisiting these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of implementing Pascal’s Triangle in Python, applying both your mathematical understanding and programming skills to develop an efficient and effective solution.

## Tasks

### 0. Pascal's Triangle

Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of `n`:

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
- You can assume `n` will be always an integer

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x00$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
pascal_triangle = __import__('0-pascal_triangle').pascal_triangle

def print_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print the triangle
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print("[{}]".format(",".join([str(x) for x in row])))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_triangle(pascal_triangle(5))
