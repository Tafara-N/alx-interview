# Must Know

For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

## Concepts Needed:

1. **Lists and List Manipulation:**

    - Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
    - [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

2. **Graph Theory Basics:**

    - Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
    - [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)

3. **Algorithmic Complexity:**

    - Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
    - [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)

4. **Recursion:**

    - Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
    - [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

5. **Queue and Stack:**

    - Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
    - [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)

6. **Set Operations:**

    - Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
    - [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

# Requirements

## General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version `3.4.3`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Lockboxes

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

- Prototype: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`
- `boxes` is a list of lists
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box
- You can assume all keys will be positive integers
    - There can be keys that do not have boxes
- The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked
- Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ cat main_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = __import__('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$
```

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ ./main_0.py
True
True
False
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$
```
