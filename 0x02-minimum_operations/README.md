For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

# Concepts Needed:

1. **Dynamic Programming:**
    - [Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
    - [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/l3JYgicNQw2Ue1Kg9jV80Q)

2. **Prime Factorization:**
    - [Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.

# Requirements

## General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version `3.4.3`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Minimum Operations

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

- Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
- Returns an integer
- If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`

**Example:**

`n = 9`

`H` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HH` => `Paste` => `HHH` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HHHHHH` => `Paste` => `HHHHHHHHH`

Number of operations: `6`

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
```
