   Description: The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking
                queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N
                queens problem.
   Usage: nqueens N:
          If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
          print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the
          status 1
   where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4:
          If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new
          line, and exit with the status 1
          If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new
          line, and exit with the status 1
   The program should print every possible solution to the problem:
          One solution per line
          Format: see example
          You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
   You are only allowed to import the sys module
